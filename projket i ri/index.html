                        <p><b>A scary story that was read to my class and somehow doesn't exist anymore?</b></p>
                        <p>So hi my name is Jasper and uh This is a weird story. And idk where else to post it So I was
                            in 1st grade, it was Halloween and so the
                            <span id="stori1" style="display: none;">
                                librarian thought it would be a great idea to read us a scary story.
                                I do not know who wrote said story but I remember "The Ghost Monster" being said in it
                                multiple times.

                                Anyways. It was a short story. So
                                It was about an old man living alone in the woods with his hounds, and in a cabin. He
                                was a hunter, and apparently his favorite part of the animals he hunted were the tails.
                                His first hunt was a rabbit, cooked the tail and ate it. Next day he went off hunting
                                again, this time he caught a strange creature, described as a black, furry creatures
                                with yellow eyes, scarve like arms and long, shiny black nails and a long tail. The
                                creature escaped but it lost its tail, which the hunter took home and ate the tail. And
                                for the rest of the night the creature stalked the man, killed his hounds and broke into
                                the house. While the man slept, the monster attacked him, ripping his stomach to shreds
                                and taking his tail back.

                                That was the end,

                                And all of first grade I've had nightmares about it

                                Idk if the librarian wrote this herself, or if it was taken off of the shelves and
                                erased from ever existing. But its been bothering me for years. I'm 19 now, and I still
                                remember this. And everyone calls me crazy. Saying oh I have an overactive imagination
                                cause apparently the story just magically stopped existing.

                                Maybe I am crazy..or something happened to the story..

                        <p><b>My YouTube history (with a little school stuff)</b></p>
                        <p>I'm a 14yr old female and have been watching YouTube since 2016 when I was in 3rd to 4th
                            grade. The first YouTuber I've watched was Chaosflo44 and his friend
                            <span id="stori3" style="display: none;">Arazhul_HD. My brother recommended them. I've made
                                a full story to them, aswell (check it out if you want). I've seen more interesting
                                YouTubers. Mostly german ones at the time. Since I was still pretty bad at english back
                                then, I could only watch the german ones. Years passed. Chaosflo44 and Arazhul_HD had a
                                fight a broke apart. Two other germans went missing. Some YouTubers changed from comedy
                                to streaming. And my brother has shown me to english YouTubers. I've joined quite a few
                                fandoms lately. The first one being FNaF and my favourite being Dream SMP. The Dream SMP
                                actually had a member who inspired me to write this story. He's called Technoblade. 10
                                months ago, on August 27th, we, his fans, found out that he had arm cancer. I was very
                                sad, since I already knew that cancer can kill people easily and doesn't have a cure. He
                                made a video about it about where he'd been. 4 months after that video, on December 24th
                                2021, he had made another video telling us how he almost became an amputee. And now, on
                                July 1st 2022, we had found out that... he had sadly passed away. The video was uploaded
                                at around 4 a.m. for me, so I was still asleep. It was also a friday for me, so I would
                                probably have had a better day without this information. Anyways, I woke up at 5.30 a.m.
                                and watched the video a little after 6 a.m. I wasn't even half into the video and
                                already started crying. After the rest of the video I wasn't sure if I was able to go to
                                school. But I couldn't tell my mother, since she probably won't understand. So I went.
                                Fridays are always 5 lessons for my class, so it wasn't that long to last. Another sad
                                part is that my classmates probably woulndn't have helped in any way. For many months
                                they were always disgusted by me, for some reason. The would aswell annoy me, talk
                                stupid with me or just back up. The always acted like they were scared of me, which made
                                me even more angry. For the passed few months I always had the thought of hurting them,
                                but I'm too scared to get into trouble. I also told my teacher, but she was never really
                                helpful. So I never told them and tried hiding. It didn't really work. I did start
                                crying at some points, but luckily no one saw me. I made it through the day. My brother
                                came home from work at around 17.30 and I'm now writing this story. I'm happy I can
                                finally finish this school year and hopefully never see those fools again.</span>

                        <p> My fiancée (F17) has this 1 best friend that she plays with (F17), talks with every single
                            day. That girls name is.. let’s call her “nat”.
                            <span id="stori4" style="display: none;">Nat used to be a friend of mine until my fiancée
                                got jealous and made me stop talking to her, I’m completely fine with that since I’m the
                                guy to be jealous, Nat has recently been trying to tell my fiancée to stop loving me and
                                to break up with me, I started to hate Nat after that, we had a big argument and she
                                took it as a joke because of course she didn’t care if my fiancée had left me.

                                Nat’s boyfriend is a very weird man (M19), I made my fiancée block him and to not speak
                                to him ever again because i suspected that he loved my fiancée because of her looks (i
                                wont explain why i think this but I’m pretty sure he does) after my fiancée blocked him,
                                he got really mad for DAYS even though they never talked that much before and that
                                pissed me off but i didn’t care as much because he was blocked and I’m sure that my
                                fiancée wouldn’t talk to him.

                                I want my fiancée to block and stop talking to her best friend because of what she has
                                tried to do and because of what she has said but she doesn’t want to because thats her
                                only friend that she really talks to every single day, what do i do?</span>

                        <p>Now, you must be thinking “someone attacked OP with a wooden board”. But no, that’s not how
                            it happened. It was just me and the board, no other individuals being directly involved in
                            the incident.
                            <span id="stori5" style="display: none;">
                                My dad has tasked my brother and I with tearing down our old fence ourselves. It’s a
                                decently sized fence, around 10 feet tall or so. We were unscrewing the screws, piling
                                the wood up, and breaking the thinner boards in half to fit them into the car to give to
                                one of my dad’s friends. We do 1 section every day.

                                Today, we chose not to use the Jigsaw to cut the thinner boards (they’re as thick as a
                                regular plank of wood). Instead, we would prop them up diagonally on the porch and stomp
                                in the middle to break it in half.

                                Now, one of the halves, right after being stomped, catapulted up. Think of it as when a
                                cartoon character steps on a rake and the handle shoots up and hits them in the face.
                                But, instead of hitting me in the face, the wooden edge nailed me right in the knee.
                                This whole thing happened in about half of a second.

                                I limped inside and curled up on the couch for a good 5 minutes, breathing heavily and
                                waiting for the pain to subside. Luckily, my knee (hopefully) wasn’t broken. Somehow, it
                                wasn’t even bruised (although the pain is still there). I definitely won’t be running or
                                jumping much for the next few days.

                                TLDR: Lazy teenager nearly breaks his knee with a plank of wood.

                                We were looking at adds and we saw the IKE for president campaign everyone was having a
                                ball so after it was over people in the class were asking "do you like IKE" . So this
                                one kid I'll call him J he said he didn't like IKE. So our teacher let's call him
                                Tomatoe. Tomatoe kicked J the smartest kid in our class out for the sole purpose of him
                                not liking IKE. I wish i could have been joking it took J 25 minutes to get back in and

                        <p>Introduction</p>
                        <p>“Keep driving!” Shouted Khalid. Him and his buddy were being chased by a group of bandits who
                            were not so happy with their presence in the city.
                            <span id="stori7" style="display: none;">
                                Khalid and his buddy had to make sure they got away from them as quickly and as far as
                                possible. Thankfully for Khalid, his buddy was an excellent driver and knew his way
                                around town. He would lead those who chased after him a dance and it was as if his
                                enemies were chasing someone non-existent. He drove through the bumpy roads and turned
                                left and right. All the while the bandits were trying to catch up to them and lead them
                                to a dead end or cause them to crash. The steering wheel was never seated in one
                                position. It was gripped by the driver's hands tightly as if he was trying to squeeze
                                something out of it. He was very cautious not to hit any civilians in the way however
                                there were a lot of damages to the car and very nearly did the enemies sometimes jump on
                                to Khalids vehicle, but Khalid and his buddy held them off and eventually got away. As
                                they were being chased Khalids buddy saw that there was only way they could escape. It
                                was a half-broken bridge and they had to make the jump. If they failed then it would all
                                be over. “Hold on!” Shouted Khalids buddy as they made the jump. Khalid and his buddy
                                held on for their dear life and amazingly made the jump. “Ha! I told you we could do
                                it,” said Khalids buddy. “I never doubted you one bit,” replied Khalid whilst breathing
                                heavily from the fear of making that jump. “That was... crazy,” said Khalid whilst
                                gripping his hands on his knees and trying to catch his breath. The right side of his
                                face was covered with mud and he had a few bruises on his arm and some very worn-out
                                clothes from all the travelling and walking and running he had to endure in order to
                                make sure he completes his journey and finds the treasure he has been so eagerly
                                seeking. “Look,” said Khalids buddy as he tapped him on his arm. “We’re here.” Khalid
                                immediately stood up straight and stopped and stared at the sight which brought pleasure
                                to his eyes. He finally believed he was going to get the answer he was so desperately
                                seeking for.

                        <p><b>The Adventures Of Khalid: The Black Stone. Part 2 </b></p>
                        <P>Chapter 1: How It All Began</P>
                        <p>From a young age Khalid was absorbed into reading books about how famous explorers found new
                            parts of the world. Or stories which told of hidden treasures which still to this day, no
                            one has been able to find
                            <span id="stori8" style="display: none;">
                                He also read about how archaeologists dug up bones or ancient sites buried underground
                                to find out more about the people of the past. This was all interesting for Khalid and
                                he was obviously fascinated by all of these stories and discoveries. But there was one
                                story which Khalid was very curious about. It was a treasure which would lead to a lost
                                kingdom. Khalid read about this treasure day and night and he would dream that he would
                                be the first to find this treasure and no one would beat him to it. It was called...
                                ‘The Black Stone.’

                                Although there are many speculations on the back stone truly existing or not. Khalid
                                would spend his free time reading about the Black Stone because he truly believed that
                                ancient treasure wasn't a fairy tale but was true. He believed that the only reason why
                                the treasure hunters of the past believed it to be false was because they themselves
                                failed to find it. Khalid had many reasons why this was. It could be because they were
                                missing some information on its exact location. Like a map or more information about its
                                history and where it ended up. It could be that the Black Stone was passed down by
                                generation after generation and now someone needs to contact the family which possess
                                the Black Stone. Or at least someone connected to the family. Khalid researched day and
                                night as a child, as a teenager and now even as a grown man. However, during his
                                childhood his father would admonish him for reading and researching about something
                                which experts doubt even exists. What does a small child like Khalid hope to gain? He
                                has not even explored his own city properly let alone exploring the world for treasure.
                                But Khalid was confident and would not let anyone get in his way. From a child he would
                                say, “I will find the Black Stone and when I do, you will all realise that It wasn’t me
                                that was mistaken, rather it was the explorers of the past.” Still his family laughed at
                                him but allowed him to read because the child's imagination will soon fade away and he
                                will come to realize what life is truly about.

                                Although Khalid loved reading these treasure hunting stories and dreamed about them in
                                his sleep, Khalid was a Muslim and a practicing one at that. He would never miss his
                                prayers and would also love spending his time doing good deeds. He would help his
                                parents around the house and be kind to them and recite the Glorious Qur’an. He loved
                                Islam and would always be reminded to hold firm on to it and not let anyone or anything
                                stop him from being firm upon it. Although his family doubted that he would find the
                                Black Stone or any treasure at all, they did not doubt that he would stop holding on to
                                Islam.</span>
